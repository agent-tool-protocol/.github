The **Agent Tool Protocol (ATP)** is a modern, cloud-native protocol that enables AI agents to discover, authenticate, and call external tools through developer-defined **ToolKits**.

Whether you're building AI-native apps, autonomous agents, or agent marketplaces, ATP gives you a lightweight, developer-first way to expose functionality to LLMs—without reinventing wrappers or managing tool routing manually.

ATP was designed to:

- ✅ Make tool usage portable across devices, apps, and agents  
- ✅ Remove friction for developers registering and publishing tools  
- ✅ Standardize agent ↔ tool communication with built-in auth and lifecycle

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Tool-first** – Tools are real Python functions, not wrappers or proxies  
- **Agent-agnostic** – Works with any agent that supports the ATP protocol  
- **Cloud-sync ready** – ToolKits sync across environments and apps  
- **Developer-first** – SDKs provide decorators, metadata, and built-in auth handling

## 🧬 About

ATP is maintained by the **ChatATP** team and contributors around the world.  
We believe AI agents should be as extensible as modern web apps — and ATP is our protocol for making that future real.
